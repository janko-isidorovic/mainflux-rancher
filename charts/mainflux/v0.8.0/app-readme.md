Mainflux is modern, scalable, secure open source and patent-free IoT cloud platform written in Go.

It accepts user and thing connections over various network protocols (i.e. HTTP,
MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP), thus making a seamless bridge between them. It is used as the IoT middleware
for building complex IoT solutions.
